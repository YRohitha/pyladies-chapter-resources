This is the slide stack and hands-on material from a PyLadies Berlin & Hamburg 2020 workshops on introduction to Docker.

Learning objectives:

- Basic understanding of what devops means
- Understanding of why docker?
- Simple tutorial for first docker image
- Basic interactions with the docker image

Pre-workshop requirements:

- Local installation of Docker
- Git account

Docker (You will need admin permission on your machine )(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/installing_docker_on_linux.htm)

- Linux https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04
- Mac https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
- Windows https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Caveat:

Docker cannot be installed on older Windows home editions. And for following the tutorial one needs access to a terminal that knows about the docker installation.
